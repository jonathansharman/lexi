# In a lexicon file, "native" settings refer to the language of the lexicon
# we're defining (in this example Esperanto), and "foreign" settings to the
# language we're translating it to/from (in this example English).

# These word classes (or parts of speech) are used to validate the class values
# in the list of lexemes. These should be the native word classes and don't need
# to map one-to-one with word classes in the foreign language.
classes:
- substantivo
- verbo
- adjektivo
- difinilo

# Optionally sort lexemes by lemma, according to a list of graphemes. Be careful
# when these graphemes include 'n' or 'y' since YAML treats those strings as
# boolean literals unless they're quoted (note the 'n' below).
sort: [a, b, c, ĉ, d, e, f, g, ĝ, h, ĥ, i, j, ĵ, k, l, m, 'n', o, p, r, s, ŝ, t, u, ŭ, v, z]

# These formatting settings control how the dictionaries are rendered. The
# format key and all nested keys are optional. Except for the titles, which
# default to blank, the following uses all default values.
format:
  # Settings for the monolingual native dictionary and for native words in the
  # translation dictionaries.
  native:
    title: Vortaro de Esperanto
    # The native prefix and suffix strings will flank each block of native text
    # in any rendered content. This can be useful for adding markup tags to use
    # a custom font, for instance.
    prefix: ''
    suffix: ''
  # Settings for the native-foreign translation dictionary.
  native_foreign:
    title: Vortaro Esperanta-Angla
    # Separates a native word from its foreign glosses.
    delimiter: ' · '
    # Separates each foreign gloss for a native word.
    gloss_delimiter: '; '
  # Settings for the foreign-native translation dictionary.
  foreign_native:
    title: English-Esperanto Dictionary
    # Separates a foreign word from its native glosses.
    delimiter: ' · '
    # Separates each native gloss for a foreign word.
    gloss_delimiter: '; '

# Most of a lexicon file will be its lexemes list. Every lexeme must include at
# least a lemma and class. The native definition is optional; if present, the
# lexeme will be included in the monolingual dictionary.
#
# The gloss field provides a many-to-many link between native and foreign
# lexemes. A lexeme will be present in both translation dictionaries if it has
# at least one gloss. If a lexeme has no glosses, it will still be included in
# the native-foreign dictionary as long as it has a translation, but it will not
# be included in the foreign-native dictionary.
#
# Lexi will warn if an entry has no definition nor translation nor any glosses.
lexemes:
- lemma: hundo
  class: substantivo
  definition: speco de amika, fela besto
  # Since this gloss overlaps very strongly with English, there's no need to
  # include a translation as well.
  glosses: [dog]
- lemma: ĉi tiu
  class: difinilo
  # "ĉi tiu" is an ordinary combination of its components, so an Esperanto
  # dictionary might not list it independently of its individual entries for
  # "ĉi" and "tiu". However, "ĉi tiu" corresponds very closely to English
  # "this", so it's useful to have entries in both translation dictionaries.
  glosses: [this]
- lemma: varma
  class: adjektivo
  # "varma" doesn't translate one-to-one with either "warm" or "hot", so it has
  # an Esperanto definition, a (not very great) English translation to clarify
  # the semantics, and multiple possible glosses. Note that HTML tags are
  # allowed in any of these fields.
  definition: ekscitanta oniajn partiklojn
  translation: >-
    warm or hot; cf. <i>varmeta</i> ("lukewarm") and <i>varmega</i> ("hot",
    "very hot")
  glosses: [warm, hot]
- lemma: krokodili
  class: verbo
  definition: paroli inter esperantistoj en lingvo krom Esperanto
  # Since "krokodili" has a translation but no glosses, it will appear in the
  # native-foreign dictionary but not the foreign-native dictionary.
  translation: to speak among Esperantists in a language besides Esperanto
